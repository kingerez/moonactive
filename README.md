Hello!

Thank you for the opportunity, and the interesting home assignment!

Here's how to run the project:

## Server
In the terminal:
1. Install dependencies: switch to /server, and run yarn
2. Start the server: on the same folder, run yarn start. The server should be running on port 3080.

## Client
In the terminal:
1. Install dependencies: switch to /client, and run yarn
2. On the same folder, run yarn start to launch the app
3. The app should be launched automatically in your browser of choice
